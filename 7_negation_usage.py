# TASK DESCRIPTION
# 7. We would like to compare the usage of negation for each ebook.
# Write a program that allow you to identify the occurrence of negation in the text
# where the negation is identified through a set of preselected terms
# (i.e., single word like not, none, or as affix as in can(nâ€˜t), (im)perfect)) using string matching method.
# Write a program that identifies the occurrence of negation in every set of five consecutive lines of the poem.
# Compare the frequency of occurrence of negation in each ebook.
# Use the code to identify the type of preposition tag-set (use Part-of-speech tag)
# that occur in the line where the negation is detected. Plot the frequency of each preposition tag in each ebook.
