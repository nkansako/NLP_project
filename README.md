To start using this project it is important to use the book files in this Github repository, these files are manually preprocessed to exclude unneccessary information such as footnotes, author biographies, Project Gutenberg information and table of contents. Therefore this project will not automatically work (or at least create good results) with any random poetry book. 

#### How to run each task?

Each task is solved in a separate file in the root of the project, the file name indicate the number of the task being solved.
